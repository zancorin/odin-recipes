    <h4> Delicious Chocolate bars that you can make at home without an oven!</h2>

    <p>There are plenty of options with these bars. If you prefer a completely unprocessed ingredient list, use pure dark chocolate, natural peanut butter, and unsweetened coconut.</p>

    <p>No-bake cookies and bars benefit greatly from the addition of coconut. The texture and the flavor can’t be beaten. If you are like me and have no plans to give up your refined sugars (and are too impatient to make a special trip to the store), use whatever ingredients happen to be in the house.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Peanut Butter</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Coconut Oil</li>
        <li>Rolled Oats</li>
        <li>Shredded Coconut</li>
        <li>Chopped Pecans</li>
        <li>Dark or Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the peanut butter, honey, and coconut oil in a medium-size saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir frequently as the mixture melts.</li>
        <li>When it has melted, remove from the heat and add the chocolate. Stir until the chocolate is completely smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the oats, coconut, and pecans. Stir to combine. Pour the mixture into an 8×8 pan. Refrigerate until the chocolate hardens, at least 3-4 hours.</li>

    </ol>
